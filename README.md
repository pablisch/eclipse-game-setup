# Eclipse Setup

This is a very basic app made without any formal training in basic JS, HTML and CSS for the purposes of: 
* practicing these languages
* providing a simple app randomising the start setup of the board game Eclipse by:
  * randomising seating positions
  * randomising gaps between players

Other start parameters remain decided by a die roll, i.e. the highest die roll decides the starting player, and species are chosen by the players in reverse order of play.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Enter the players' names in the `allPlayers` array on line 1 of the `script.js` file.
3. Run `open index.html` in the terminal to open the app in your browser.

The app will randomly assign seating positions and gaps between players. Refreshing the page will re-randomise the seating positions and gaps.
